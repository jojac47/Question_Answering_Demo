    "    The Force Structure consists of organisational arrangements that bring together the forces placed at the Alliance’s disposal by the member countries, along with their associated command and control structures.

To keep pace with all these changes and future challenges, the Command Structure and way of doing business are constantly evolving. Additionally, the permanent exchange of information and specialised knowledge as well as experience between military experts and the political actors at NATO Headquarters are a constant and continual means of mutual education.

    " Super Bowl LVI[12] was an American football game played to determine the champion of the National Football League (NFL) for the 2021 season. The National Football Conference (NFC) champion Los Angeles Rams defeated the American Football Conference (AFC) champion Cincinnati Bengals, 23–20. The game was played on February 13, 2022, at SoFi Stadium in Inglewood, California, the home stadium of the Rams, marking the second consecutive and second overall Super Bowl to feature a team playing and winning in its home stadium.[13][14][15][16]\n",
    "\n",
    "    The Rams' victory was their second, first as a Los Angeles-based team, and first since 1999's Super Bowl XXXIV when they were based in St. Louis. Finishing with a 12–5 record, the Rams reached their fifth appearance after acquiring veteran quarterback Matthew Stafford, who had not won a playoff game in his previous 12 years with the Detroit Lions. The Bengals, who finished with a 10–7 record, were seeking their first Super Bowl title following several decades of losing seasons and playoff struggles. They won their first playoff game since 1990, ending the longest drought in the four major North American sports, en route to their third Super Bowl appearance and first since 1988's Super Bowl XXIII. Each team finished the regular season as their respective conference's 4-seed, making this the first Super Bowl without a top-3 seed since seeding was introduced in 1975.[17]\n",
    "\n",
    "    The game had three lead changes and mostly kept within a one-possession margin. Los Angeles led 13–10 at halftime, but the Bengals scored 10 straight points on their first two drives in the third quarter. Trailing 20–16 in the fourth, the Rams scored a touchdown to retake the lead with under two minutes remaining and stopped Cincinnati's final drive on downs. Wide receiver Cooper Kupp, who converted a fourth down on the Rams' final drive and scored the game-winning touchdown, was named Super Bowl MVP.\n",

    "Overwatch 2 is a hero shooter, where players are split into two teams and select a \"hero\" from a roster of 35 characters. Characters are organized into a \"damage\" class, responsible for offensive efforts; a \"support\" class, responsible for healing and buffing; and a \"tank\" class, responsible for the team's protection. Each character has a unique set of skills, made up of active, passive, and an ultimate ability. Overwatch 2, like its predecessor, primarily centers on player versus player (PvP) combat across several different modes and maps, and includes both casual and ranked competitive matches.\n",
    "\n",
    "A major departure from the first game was the choice to remove a tank slot per team thus reducing teams to five players. According to game director Aaron Keller, developers hoped that losing a tank would speed up gameplay as they believed that the original six players scheme rendered gameplay slow. It is also intended to ease the amount of things players and spectators need to watch out for. New maps were designed to include more cover options to compensate for reduced tank-based protection.[1] Additionally, Damage heroes now have an increased movement speed and Support heroes slowly regenerate, while Tank heroes were redesigned so they could take on a more offensive role. Heroes were visually refurbished as to reflect the few years of in-game time that has passed since the events of the first game.[2] Overwatch 2 will furthermore include a ping system to direct the attention of teammates to specific points on the map.[3]\n",
    "\n",
    "The game also introduces a new PvP mode named \"Push\", similar to tug of war, teams vie for control of a robot that pushes a team's payload to the opponent's side of the map. Next to being incorporated into Quick and Competitive play, Push will become part of the standard map rotation of the Overwatch League.[4] Some existing gameplay modes may be dropped in Overwatch 2; former game director Jeff Kaplan has stated that two control point maps, Paris and Horizon Lunar Colony, will likely not be available in Overwatch 2 as these have been deemed unbalanced in response community feedback.[5]\n",
    "\n",
    "The game will feature player versus environment (PvE) game modes. Similar to the special seasonal events, they will consist of four-player cooperative missions against non-playable characters and will be available on a permanent as opposed to a seasonal basis. In this mode, players can garner experience points for their hero and unlock new passive abilities called \"talents\", allowing them to influence how the hero plays. At least two PvE modes will be added; a story-based mission mode, where players are limited to their hero selection in replaying missions based on Overwatch lore, and Hero missions which allow all heroes to be used in fending off waves of enemies at various locations. Blizzard anticipates that Overwatch 2 will offer over 100 different PvE missions, utilizing new maps as well as existing multiplayer maps expanded out to include new areas, and adding in dynamic effects, such as day and night times as well as varying weather conditions. Enemy types will be expanded out from the Null Sector robots that were introduced in the original seasonal PvE events, adding in new types with unique behaviors.[6][2]\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwatch 2 will be released as a free-to-play game, rather than a premium priced game. It will also discontinue loot boxes in favor of a battle pass system to be offered on a seasonal basis which will correspond with the introduction of new maps and heroes. The game will also include an in-game store where players can purchase cosmetics directly.[7][8] Blizzard stated that new heroes will be introduced as rewards on the free tier of the battle pass, and players who fail to make the associated tier will have other routes to obtain the hero for free in later seasons.[9]\n",
    "\n",
    "A Battle.net account will be required to play Overwatch 2, regardless of platform. Overwatch 2 will feature cross-progression, with in-game cosmetic items and progress being shared across PC and console versions.[10] Unlocked cosmetic items, in-game currency, and player statistics from any Overwatch profile linked to such an account will be merged, and will be available on all platforms upon release. Competitive skill ratings will continue to be separate, with console and PC ranks remaining independent of each other.[11]\n",
    "\n",
    "Development\n",
    "Overwatch 2 was announced at BlizzCon on November 1, 2019, with plans that the game would maintain a \"shared multiplayer environment\" between it and the original Overwatch, so that players in either game can compete in the existing player versus player (PvP) game modes, retaining all unlocked cosmetics and other features.[6] Jeff Kaplan explained that this was a major decision and that he had to justify this \"player-first standpoint\" to Blizzard executives, given the current industry trend to draw in new sales.[12] All new heroes, maps, and PvP modes were to be added to both games to maintain this shared environment.[13] However, Overwatch 2 was later announced as a free-to-play title, and that on its release on October 4, 2022, Blizzard affirmed that Overwatch 2 live services will replace those of the original game; the original Overwatch servers will be shut down on October 2, 2022.[14] Players will retain their exisiting cosmetics and in-game currency, while the remaining loot boxes will be opened automatically upon release of Overwatch 2.[15] At least three new heroes will be added to the roster, including Sojourn, a Canadian Overwatch officer, Junker Queen, the ruler of Junkertown, and Kiriko.[16][17]\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwatch 2 runs on an upgraded version of the original game's engine which allows for larger map sizes to better support the new story-based PvE elements.[6] Additionally, all of the existing heroes are getting visual redesigns for Overwatch 2, although Blizzard does not expect every hero to have theirs finished by the time Overwatch 2 launches, with twelve of the existing 31 completed at the time of the game's reveal.[16]\n",
    "\n",
    "Overwatch 2 is slated to release for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Windows, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X/S in early access on October 4, 2022.[17] Kaplan stated they were more concerned about quality of the product than timeliness of the release.[18][19] Investor documents released in November 2021 reported that the initial 2022 release window was delayed to at least 2023, intended for \"giving the teams some extra time to complete production and continue growing their creative resources to support the titles after launch\".[20] Kaplan anticipated that Overwatch and Overwatch 2 will ultimately merge into a single product to avoid having any engine differences affecting player experience.[21] Technical director John Lafleur has stated they are also interested in supporting, at minimum, cross-platform progression and are looking at the possibility of cross-platform play.[22] In the interim from its announcement prior to release, Kaplan left Blizzard in April 2021, with Aaron Keller taking over the lead development role,[23] while the lead developer for new heroes, Geoff Goodman, left sometime in mid-2022.[24]\n",
    "\n",
    "In March 2022, Blizzard stated that they had put too much focus on Overwatch 2 over the past few years to the detriment of support of the original game, and have changed plans to release Overwatch 2 in parts, with the PvP portion to be released in beta form starting in April 2022 and the PvE part to come at a later time. This would allow them to also continue to support Overwatch alongside Overwatch 2's development.[25][26] Later, Blizzard announced that the first wave of Overwatch 2 invitation-only betas would begin on April 26, 2022, and end on May 17. Access to the closed beta could be earned either by signing up for a chance to participate or by watching select Twitch streamers for a limited time on April 27.[27][28]\n",
    "\n",
    "The game without its PVE mode was released as early access on October 4, 2022, for Windows, PlayStation 4 and 5, Xbox One and Series X/S, and Nintendo Switch.[29] That day, in addition to a large number of players, the game's servers were hit with a distributed denial of service (DDOS) attack that made it difficult for many to access the game.[30] Additionally, as part of Blizzard's efforts to reduce smurfing, the use of new accounts by experienced players as to try to game the system, the company required all players to confirm their identity through a SMS message on their cell phone linked to their account. For many with prepaid cellular plans, particularly in the United States, they cannot use SMS on their plans, and effectively locked them out of Overwatch 2, though Blizzard stated they were working to resolve that issue.[31] By October 7, Blizzard removed the need to verify one's identity for those that had played Overwatch since at least June 2021.[32]\n",
